Human Eidtable Object Notation (Heon)
JSON but actually for Humans and not for machines

### Motavation:
The Orignal Motativation for this project was to support various feature that i needed as a defination mark up  language for my game engine. While json would have worked - its not very friendly for rappid intreaciton and readablity -  importantly it cannot reperesnt inline script readably - scripts are genernal  encoded as single line  text with escaped characters wrapped quoted  in json . Additionably Josn as not support for unsinged integers - these commonly used and index for array and ids.

Contiuning with the pain of standard josn is trailing comma - cause passing error - none standard support for comments other issues expected working with json

In term of parse effectency json is allready quite slow  and any performance  gain not allow trail comma - its directly offset by the pain the cause develops while itreacting and editing json arrays and objects.

All the being said the goals of this project is explore  improvements to that can be made to a JSON like object notation langauage that is far more human and user friendly - parsing preformance in not a poirity for this project
